[Null Pointers](https://nullpointers.io) is your opinionated podcast on development, tech and every day struggles. After bumping into each other a few times at conferences and in the virtual world Gerald, Mark and Steven decided to start a podcast. Being developers ourselves means we cover development topics most of the time. Still, we don't shy away from moving outside of our little comfort zone.

## Who are we?

### Mark Allibone

Living in Switzerland and working during the day on .NET Solutions with a focus on mobile, IoT and web (mostly backend) development. I enjoy working in teams with an Agile/DevOps mindset and am always trying to improve the things that I am doing.
During my downtime, I like to do sports, learn new things, [blog](https://mallibone.com), hang out with friends and family or enjoy a walk with the dog.
You can always find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mallibone.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/mallibone) ðŸ™‚

Can be bribed with: Coffee, chocolate, cookies and beer.

### Steven Thewissen

A software developer from the Netherlands focusing on Xamarin development, crafting fancy UIs, tinkering in Azure DevOps and developing REST APIs. I started working with Xamarin in 2014 and have been in love with it ever since. When I'm not [coding](https://github.com/sthewissen), you can find me [writing blogs](https://thewissen.io), [skeeting](https://bsky.app/profile/thewissen.io), playing soccer, or just having some fun and the occasional drink with my friends. If you bring cookies, chocolate and/or a nice beer, we can quickly become best friends.

### Gerald Versluis

Hi! Iâ€™m Gerald Versluis, a software developer from the Netherlands. Besides just writing code, I also try to share my knowledge through [my blog](https://blog.verslu.is), [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/GeraldVersluis), public speaking and writing books and articles. And now a podcast!

Iâ€™m mainly focussing on creating apps, especially by the means of Xamarin and everything that has to do with it. But an app is not complete without a proper backend, right? So, Iâ€™m not afraid of some ASP.NET (Core) or other web applications. I also like to tinker around with all kinds of other things, like continuous delivery and continuous integration, everything Azure, a little bit of AI, etc. Have a look at my [GitHub account](https://github.com/jfversluis) for some of my work at a glance.
