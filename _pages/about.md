[Null Pointers](https://nullpointers.io) is your opinionated podcast on development, tech and every day struggles. After bumping into each other a few times at conferences and in the virtual world Gerald, Mark and Steven decided to start a podcast. Being developers ourselves means we cover development topics most of the time. Still, we don't shy away from moving outside of our little comfort zone.

## Who are we?

### Gerald Versluis

He's a guy. That likes pink fluffy unicorns.

### Mark Allibone

Living in Switzerland and working during the day on .Net Solutions with a focus on mobile, IoT and web (mostly backend) development. I enjoy working in teams with an Agile/DevOps mindset and am always trying to improve the things that I am doing.
During my downtime, I like to do sports, learn new things, blog, hang out with friends and family or enjoy a walk with the dog.
Hope we will have the chance to meet in person at some point be it over some coffee, tea or beer ðŸ™‚

### Steven Thewissen

A software developer from the Netherlands focusing on Xamarin development, crafting fancy UIs, tinkering in Azure DevOps and developing REST APIs. I started working with Xamarin in 2014 and have been in love with it ever since. When I'm not coding, you can find me writing blogs, tweeting, playing soccer, or just having some fun and the occasional drink with my friends. If you bring cookies, chocolate and/or a nice beer, we can quickly become best friends.
