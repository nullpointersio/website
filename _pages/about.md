[Null Pointers](https://nullpointers.io) is your opinionated podcast on development, tech and every day struggles. After bumping into eachother a few times at conferences and in the virtual world Gerald, Mark and Steven decided to start a podcast. Being developers ourselves means we cover development topics most of the time, but we don't shy away from moving outside of our little comfort zone.

## Who are we?

### Gerald Versluis

Software developer from the Netherlands focusing on Xamarin development, crafting fancy UIs, tinkering in Azure DevOps and developing REST APIs. I started working with Xamarin in 2014 and have been in love with it ever since. When I'm not coding you can find me writing blogs, tweeting, playing soccer, or just having some fun and the occasional drink with my friends. If you bring cookies, chocolate and/or a nice beer we can quickly become best friends.
