title: 			"8: (Mobile) Security"
url:            "8"
subtitle: 		"Everything we know about (mobile) security"
summary: 		"Episode eight is all about security. We talk about certificates, OAuth, how Gerald got hacked, Have I Been Pwned and security-specific to mobile apps."

description: 	"In this episode, we share some things we know about security in general, but also specific to mobile apps. Gerald had a hacking incident on one of his web apps which triggered us to explore what we actually know about security. It's quite easy to make a mistake, and the internet is very unforgiving, people (or bots?) will exploit it in no time. Other than that we talk about SQL injection, open redirects, Have I Been Pwned, certificates and more!"
